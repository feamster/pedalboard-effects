# Feature Specification: Guitar Pedalboard Effects Chain

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a pedalboard effects chain for my guitar (via audio interface input which is a Scarlett) based on Python's pedalboard library. eventually I would like to incorporate other synth effects."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A guitarist wants to connect their guitar to their computer via a Scarlett audio interface and apply real-time digital effects to create a custom pedalboard effects chain. The user should be able to add, remove, reorder, and adjust parameters of various guitar effects (distortion, reverb, delay, etc.) in real-time while playing. Eventually, the system should support additional synthesizer effects for expanded sound design capabilities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a guitar connected to a Scarlett audio interface, **When** the user starts the application, **Then** audio input should be detected and processed in real-time
2. **Given** an active audio connection, **When** the user adds a distortion effect to the chain, **Then** the guitar signal should be processed with distortion and output immediately
3. **Given** multiple effects in the chain, **When** the user reorders effects by dragging, **Then** the audio processing order should update immediately
4. **Given** an effect is selected, **When** the user adjusts effect parameters (e.g., gain, tone), **Then** the audio output should reflect changes in real-time
5. **Given** a configured effects chain, **When** the user saves the preset, **Then** they should be able to recall it later

### Edge Cases
- What happens when audio interface is disconnected during use?
- How does system handle audio buffer underruns or latency issues?
- What occurs when too many effects cause CPU overload?
- How are invalid parameter values handled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect and connect to Scarlett audio interface input
- **FR-002**: System MUST process guitar audio input in real-time with minimal latency
- **FR-002b**: System MUST support dual input processing (guitar + vocal microphone simultaneously)
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to add guitar effects to an effects chain
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to remove effects from the chain
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to reorder effects in the processing chain
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to adjust effect parameters in real-time
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide common guitar effects (boost, distortion, reverb, delay, etc.)
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to bypass individual effects without disabling UI controls
- **FR-008b**: Bypassed effects MUST remain configurable (parameters adjustable while bypassed)
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to save and load effect chain presets
- **FR-010**: System MUST support future addition of synthesizer effects [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what types of synth effects - filters, oscillators, modulators?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle audio interface disconnection gracefully
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide visual feedback for effect status and parameters
- **FR-013**: System MUST mix multiple input channels to stereo output

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: Audio latency MUST be under 10ms for real-time guitar processing
- **PR-002**: System MUST maintain stable audio processing under normal CPU load conditions
- **PR-003**: Effect parameter changes MUST be applied in real-time without audio dropouts
- **PR-004**: Bypass state changes MUST not cause UI freezing or unresponsiveness

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Effects Chain**: Ordered sequence of audio effects, contains effect instances and their parameters
- **Audio Effect**: Individual processing unit with adjustable parameters, bypass state, and effect type
- **Preset**: Saved configuration of an effects chain including all effect types, order, and parameter values
- **Audio Interface**: Hardware connection providing guitar input and processed audio output
- **Effect Parameter**: Configurable value that controls effect behavior (gain, frequency, time, etc.)
